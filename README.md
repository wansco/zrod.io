# zrod.io
Flexible rod design

## Overview
zrod.io provides a simple API to process rod design input data using the industry standard wave equation method. This repository contains example implementations for the front end UI.

#### Architecture
In an effort to avoid the complicated licensing models and dongles required by other software solutions, we have placed all the mathematical models on a hosted server and provide access through a simple API. This allows us to open source the front-end code. You are free to modify the source code in accordance with the GPL. If you wish to modify the code and distribute a commercial version, please contact me.

### API Key
zrod.io requires an API Key and an account to access the service. Please contact me to obtain an API Key for testing. Please note that the API authentication process is likely to change. Please do not hard-code your API key as that is subject to revocation.


#### Project State
I am still developing the documentation and front end source code. Please check back as I will be updating this repository in the near future.
